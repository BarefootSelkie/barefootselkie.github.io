      <p>As part of my research for my <a href="/articles/wheels-on-uk-coaches/">UK Coach Travel with a Wheelchair</a> post I attempted to book tickets on a National Express coach for travel between Nottingham and London. So was going to review their service while I was at it, unfortunately after three days of playing phone tennis with them I was informed that my Quickie Helium wheelchair was ‘unsafe’ to use on a coach. So unless I could dismantle the chair, climb the steps into the coach and use a regular seat I would not be allowed to travel. So while this isn’t a full review of their service, I can review what I know and have learnt from the experience.<span id="more"></span></p>
<h2 id="Booking-Process"><a href="#Booking-Process" class="headerlink" title="Booking Process"></a>Booking Process</h2><p>Like most people travelling I first went to the website and followed through the booking process on-line. Only to be presented with a message that reads ‘If anyone in your party needs a helping hand or uses a wheelchair, please call us as soon as you’ve booked your coach tickets and no later than 36 hours before you are due to travel on 08717 81 81 79 (0444 8717 81 81 79 from overseas).Please try and call us as soon as you can to check that your make of wheelchair is compatible for travel on our coaches.’. Given that it talks about compatibility of wheelchairs I decided to give the number a call before paying for a non-refundable ticket.</p>
<p>The first problem I hit was that the phone number given on their website does not actually work. When I called it got an automated voice that said the number was out of service and gave a new number to call. Unfortunately as this was unexpected I had nothing to note this new number down on and the number was given too fast to try and memorise it. So a second call to the non-working premium rate number was needed to get the correct number to call (which turned out to be 03717818181).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-Calls-Day-1"><a href="#Phone-Calls-Day-1" class="headerlink" title="Phone Calls Day 1"></a>Phone Calls Day 1</h3><p>I phoned at just after ten am on a Wednesday for travel the following Tuesday, as the website said a minimum of 36 hours. Which is really not good for spontaneous travel, as a wheelchair user it is impossible to just go to their site buy a ticket and get a coach in a few hours. </p>
<p>To their credit my initial time on hold was fairly quick, after two automated menus I waited about 5 minutes. Which isn’t bad as there was a warning they where experiencing high call volumes.</p>
<p>After explaining that I was a wheelchair user and that I had a ridged chair I was told that they would need to check to see if my chair was safe to carry. So I gave them the make and model of my chair and was put on hold. There I sat for 8 minutes while the operator was off doing something. When they came back they told me that they couldn’t find out if they where able to carry me on my wheels and that they would send it to a different department to call me back. I said that I wasn’t in and could I call back in a few hours, they said that was fine.</p>
<p>When I phone back a few hours later I went through the same menu system and spoke to a different person who once again said the department that dealt with wheelchair bookings wasn’t available. So they took my name and number and said that they’d call me back tomorrow, as I’d explained that I was at an end of year party that night and wouldn’t be available to answer my phone. </p>
<p>Two hours after this phone call they called me back, needless to say I  missed the call as being in a crowded and noisy pub is not a place to try and have a phone conversation. They left a message saying to call back when I got the message, which leads me onto the next day.</p>
<h3 id="Phone-Calls-Day-2"><a href="#Phone-Calls-Day-2" class="headerlink" title="Phone Calls Day 2"></a>Phone Calls Day 2</h3><p>After a conversation on twitter with National Express it turns out that they number I’ve been using is only for sales. From what I’ve been told it is impossible for someone to call them up and directly speak to a member of their disability team. You have to go through sales, give them a name and phone number, and then wait for them to call you back within 48 hours.</p>
<p>This is looking even less good for any type of spontaneous travel as a wheelchair user. But I persevered, I called the sales team up again, went through the menu option that says for disability assisted travel. Spoke to a pleasant but in the end useless person, as they weren’t able to help me. So I gave them my name, my phone number, and set times to call within when I would be available to answer the phone. After tweeting about this their twitter team also took the same details and waited for the call back.</p>
<p>It’s now been 24 hours since I started trying to book a ticket and arrange a wheelchair space and I’m no closer to doing that.</p>
<h3 id="Phone-Calls-Day-3"><a href="#Phone-Calls-Day-3" class="headerlink" title="Phone Calls Day 3"></a>Phone Calls Day 3</h3><p>I received a phone call from a rather terse person about half past six in the evening informing me that my wheelchair was ‘unsafe to have on the coach’ and that ‘it could only be taken as luggage if it folded’ and I was ‘able to climb the steps and sit in a seat’. I did try asking why my wheelchair was deemed unsafe but was told that they ‘could not discuss that with me’, at which point I gave up on trying to travel with them.</p>
<h2 id="Summing-Up"><a href="#Summing-Up" class="headerlink" title="Summing Up"></a>Summing Up</h2><p>So I unfortunately didn’t get to travel, which is not good, I would say that they’re a company to avoid travelling with unless you’re a non-wheelchair user or you’ve got a wheelchair that can be folded up. All the staff I dealt with, with the exception of the last one, where very pleasant and tried to be helpful. But sadly the companies system just meant that travel was impossible. </p>
<p>The pros of them are that they are very cheap, on line tickets are about half the price of a train ticket(*1) (not including rail card discount). Although that’s only for tickets bought on line and in advance, National Express do not offer walk up or open tickets for wheelchair users.</p>
<p>The cons are that there is no way of knowing if they’ll even allow you to travel without going through a lengthy process involving at least two phone calls. It seems like they are unable to carry people in the vast majority of wheelchairs, I have emailed them and asked for a list of wheelchairs they coaches are able to carry. They are also about twice the journey time of a a train(*2) not counting any traffic or delays. There is no way to just walk up and get on the next available coach as a wheelchair user, they won’t even guarantee that a coach could carry a wheelchair as not all of their fleet is wheelchair accessible.</p>
<p>Overall I would really not recommend bothering trying to book with them if you’re a wheelchair user, if you’ve got the time to wait on their calls it’s possibly worth a go once if you need to save that money. But the longer journey times and lack of ability to just buy a ticket and travel makes the process quite unappealing. </p>
<h2 id="Notes"><a href="#Notes" class="headerlink" title="Notes"></a>Notes</h2><p>There have been numerous public tweets exchanged between my twitter account and national express’ while I’ve been attempting to make this booking. So this will have helped speed up the process in getting call backs. My personal opinion is that if a company is running you around politely name and shame them on social media. It can work wonders for getting you faster help than just sitting and hoping.</p>
<p>*1 : The comparison I ran was being on a coach or a train that day, without discounted tickets. National Express quoted me £9 (€10.70) plus a £1 (€1.20) booking fee, a ticket on The Train Line would have been £21 (€25) with no booking fee. This is for fixed time coaches / trains, if either of them were missed a ticket would have to be re-bought. </p>
<p>*2 : The comparison I ran was the quickest possible journey time between Nottingham and London regardless of the ticket price. National Express’ quickest possible time was an estimated 3 hours 5 minutes, compared to East Midlands Trains at 1 hour 42 minutes.</p>
