      <p>I have quite the thing for luggage and storage systems both in general and for use when I’m travelling, here I take a closer look at my own personal Everday Carry Bag (EDC). What I use, what I keep in it, and why, to give ideas for creating your own.<span id="more"></span></p>
<h2 id="Why"><a href="#Why" class="headerlink" title="Why?"></a>Why?</h2><p>The idea behind having an Everyday Carry Bag is to try and keep everything that I absoultly need close at hand. It’s a little bigger than a wallet but smaller than a bag that I could put other items into.</p>
<p>I try and keep my Everday Carry Bag (EDC) as small and light as possible, so this is less of a bag and more my wallet / purse that carries everything that’s really important to have on had. It has to be small and light enough that when I’m without my wheelchair I can carry it on me without causing a problem. My current bag is a LifeVenture&lt;%- ncpr %&gt; Belt Pack (although never worn as a belt pack).</p>
<p>While the bag is called the LiveVenture Belt Pack I almost never carry it on my belt, it spends it’s time either strapped to the back of my back rest or slung over my shoulder on a shoulder strap. So I’ve swapped the shoulder strap out from the 20mm that the bag came with to a much thicker 50mm strap as I find them a lot more comfortable to use. When I’m walking and having a good day I’ll add a small amount of weight to the bag by detaching my LowePro&lt;%- ncpr %&gt; Dashpoint 10 camera case from my wheelchair and addit it to the shoulder strap.</p>
<h2 id="What-goes-in-the-bag"><a href="#What-goes-in-the-bag" class="headerlink" title="What goes in the bag?"></a>What goes in the bag?</h2><ul>
<li>Smart Phone </li>
<li>Debit Card</li>
<li>Pre-paid Debit Card</li>
<li>Passholder Case<ul>
<li>Bus Pass</li>
<li>Railcard</li>
<li>Oyster PAYG Card (behind Railcard)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rainbow Clipper Lighter&lt;%- ncpr %&gt;</li>
<li>Sharpie Twin Tip Perment Marker&lt;%- ncpr %&gt;</li>
<li>Theme Park Pass + Companion Pass</li>
<li>Eggshell Stickers &amp; Art Trading Card Cards</li>
<li>USB Thumb Drive</li>
<li>Pill Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>I try not to have loyalty cards in my day to day bag, as you quickly amass so many of them they start making a small bag very bulky and half the time I forget that they exist anyway. For those that I can I’ve moved them onto my phone, for those I can’t I’ve almost stopped using them. If they add bulk and don’t have an imeditate benifit to me I tend not to carry them around.</p>
<p>When I go out to clubs, pubs, or parties at night this further gets reduced to just my phone and pre-paid debit card stuff into my bra starp.</p>
