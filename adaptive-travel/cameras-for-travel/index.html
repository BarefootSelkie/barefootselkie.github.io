      <p>My opinion on cameras is that the best camera for travel is the one you have on you. Life happens and if you want to capture it the camera you have to hand is the best one for the job. While there’s no denying that with a lot of experience and time a DSLR will produce an amazing photo, the advancements in camera technology both compact cameras and phones are also producting amazing photographs and videos.<span id="more"></span></p>
<p>So for most people the best camera will be the camera built into their smart phone, as it’s always on them and norally to hand. If you want slightly more than just a smart phone camera my recomendation is a compact superzoom camera. Personally I use the Panasonic Lumix TZ-40&lt;%- ncpr %&gt; and find it to be an amazing camera for travel. It’s small enough that it fits on the strap of my EDC Bag, has all of the features of a mid-range DSLR and packs a 20x optical zoom (equivlent of 28mm to 700mm on a 35mm). </p>
<p>Memory cards for your camera are a ballancing act, you want to have enough storage space that you don’t need to be swapping memory cards on a regular basis. While at the same time avoiding the all your eggs in one basket situation of having everything on one card. Personally I have found that 32Gb cards work very well for me, they have enough space that even shooting HDR or RAW I have enough space for several days worth of photographs. While at the same time being cheap enough that I can have 4 cards with me while travelling. I tend to keep one card in the camera, one in the card pocket in the case and the other two in my luggage. That way if something goes wrong and I lose a card or my camera I don’t lose everything.</p>
