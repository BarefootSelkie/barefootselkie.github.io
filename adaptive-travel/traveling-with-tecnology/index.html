      <p>The best advice for what technology to take with you when you’re travelling is to try and do as much as possible with as little as possible.<span id="more"></span></p>
<p>Modern smart phones are pretty much the killer app when it comes to technology to travel with, they roll so much capibility into a very tiny decive that most people carry with them at all times. If you’re specing a new phone with travel in mind go for the best phone with the most storage that you can get for your money. Smart phones are great for travel as they roll your phone, camera, computer, media player, handheld games console, and much more into one device. </p>
<p>With a phone, decient sized memory card, and some cables it’s quite possible to hook the phone up to a TV or Monitor and watch videos. Or link a bluetooth keyboard and work on documents, a proportion of this site is written on an iPhone using Textastic and Working Copy. So it just being a phone is certainly not something that you should consider a limit.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re buying Apple a good peice of advice of advice is to try and get the last generation of phone, as it’ll be supported for three plus years and will cost a lot less. Get the biggest internial storage you can afford, as added extra storage to Apple decives is difficult to impossible most of the time.</li>
<li>If you’re buying Android looking at what you can get on import is a good idea, you can get some really amazingly good phones for a lot less than the branded ones. Most Android phones come with a Micro SD card slot, so get the biggest SD card the phone will support.</li>
</ul>
<p>{Batteries}</p>
<p>It is a good idea to also have a feature phone with you as well, as these simpler phones have much more battery life than a smart phone normally in the region of a week. It can sometimes be a while between charges and while I’ve had a couple of days out of my iPhone’s[NPR] battery it’s a good idea to have a back up incase you need to call someone. Same for if you manage to lose or break your smartphone on your travels, a more rebust easy to replace backup is a good idea.</p>
<p>If you need something a bit bigger than a phone, go with a tablet, the same information and advice applies to Android or iOS tablets as to phones, they are very simlar peices of technology.</p>
<p>Cameras are personal taste, in my opinion the best camera for travel is the one you have on you. Life happens and if you want to capture it the camera you have to hand is the best one for the job. So for most people that would be the camera build into their smart phone, but if you want you can read more of my thouths on <a href="/articles/cameras-for-travel">cameras for travel</a>.</p>
<p>Unless you really need a computer when you’re travelling it’s a good idea to try and avoid travelling with a latop computer. A good phone or tablet can do almost anything a laptop can, with the benefit of being typically smaller, lighter, and having a better battery life. That being said there are some very good choices of laptop for those of us who do need a full computer when travelling.</p>
<p>Giving advice on a travel laptop is very difficult, as is giving any general advice on buying comptuer hardward. Go with as much battery power as you can get out of one that meets the rest of your specifications. As for whether to go for a Mac or PC based laptop my advice would be to go with the OS enviroment that you’re used to. So if you’re a Windows (like me) or Linux user go with a PC based laptop, if you’re a MacOS user go with a Mac. There’s little difference between the platforms other than personal preferences and a very small amount of software.</p>
<p>Personally I have a Lenovo Yoga 3 [NPR] which is not a laptop I’d recomend, while it’s small and light with a good battery life, it’s horrbiliy underpowered and with only 128 Gb internial storage it struggles to even keep my photo collection, nevermind music and video collections.</p>
<p>Heldheld games consoles are another thing that’s personal taste, if you like them take one, personally I’ve given up carrying my Nintendo 3DS around with me as I was only playing one game and it was bulk, heavy, with a poor batter life. I’ve had to accept that I won’t be playing more Pokemon until there’s a phone version of it.</p>
<h2 id="A-special-note-about-headphones"><a href="#A-special-note-about-headphones" class="headerlink" title="A special note about headphones"></a>A special note about headphones</h2><p>An easily forgotten peice of technology that you’re likely to travel with, and one that’s based on a lot of personal choice. My recomendations are as small and light as possible, bluetooth is nice so you don’t have cables to get tangled up in as well. If you’ve ever accidently caught your headphone cable while trying to push yourself on wheels you’ll know how frustrating and chaos causing that is. Also noise cancelling is nice if it works for you, I’m unluck enough to be one of the small number of people who can percieve the cancelation and so they don’t work for me. If you can wear them there are various in ear headphones that work great and are great to travel with. Personally I have a pair of Bose [NCPR]</p>
<h2 id="Personal-Notes"><a href="#Personal-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Personal Notes"></a>Personal Notes</h2><p>I will admit it, I travel with a massive amount of technology, a lot more than I should. I keep trying to trim it down so it’s more sensible, but everytime I do my ADHD / Autistic worries about keeping myself occupied bump it back up. Currently I travel with a laptop computer, externial 2 Tb hard disc, tablet computer, two mobile phones (one smart, one feture), and a camera. To be honest I should be choosing between the tablet computer and laptop, as the both fill mostly the same function. But I haven’t found a realiable way of carrying all my music, videos, and books, which are stored on the 2Tb hard disc, and accessing them on the tablet without a computer. Then the laptop </p>
